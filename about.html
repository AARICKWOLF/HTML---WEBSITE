            <h2>What is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)?</h2>
            <p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings. It encompasses the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and the study of major phenomena surrounding them.</p>
            <p>HCI draws from cognitive psychology, computer science, design, and other fields to create a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and improving the user experience with technology.</p>
            <p>Some key areas within HCI include user interface design, usability testing, accessibility, interaction design, and user-centered design methodologies.</p>
            <p>Effective HCI leads to intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and computers, resulting in better user experiences and improved productivity.</p>
